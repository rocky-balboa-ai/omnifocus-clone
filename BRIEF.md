# OmniFocus Clone - Project Brief

## Goal
Build a full-featured web app clone of OmniFocus for personal task management.

## Users
- Fred (human) - will use the web UI to manage and view tasks
- Rocky (AI assistant) - will use an API to manage Fred's recurring tasks programmatically

## Key Use Cases
- Passport renewals and document expiry tracking
- Monthly recurring payments (maid salary, bills)
- General GTD task management

## Requirements
- **Platform**: Web app (responsive, works on desktop and mobile browsers)
- **Features**: Full OmniFocus feature clone - research their docs thoroughly
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (local, no cloud sync needed)
- **Auth**: Simple auth (single user is fine, or basic login)
- **API**: Needs an API for programmatic access (so Rocky can manage tasks)

## OmniFocus Core Features to Clone
- Inbox (quick capture)
- Projects (sequential & parallel)
- Tags/Contexts
- Defer dates & Due dates
- Perspectives (custom filtered views)
- Review cycle
- Repeating/recurring tasks
- Forecast view
- Flagged items
- Notes & attachments per task

## Tech Stack Preferences
- Open to suggestions, but something modern and maintainable
- PostgreSQL for database
- Good API design for automation

## Not Needed
- Cloud sync / multi-device sync (single instance is fine)
- Mobile native apps (responsive web is enough)
- Team/collaboration features
